		<p>The development of this website marks the beginning of a new chapter in my professional story. However, my story began a few years back when I graduated from James Madison University with a degree in Communications and Computer Information Systems.</p><br>

		<p>Shockingly, at the ripe age of 22, I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do for a living, but digital marketing sounded like a field where I could incorporate my technical knowledge, as well as my creative outlook. So, I applied and interviewed, and applied and interviewed some more, and finally landed a job in Charlotte, NC.</p><br>

		<p>After soaking up, quite possibly, the last summer break I'll ever have, I made the move from Richmond, VA to the dirty south to pursure a career in digital marketing. After spending nearly two years in an SEO role, I recently decided to pivot the direction of my career and begin the journey of becoming of a front-end developer.</p><br>

		<p>Over the next few months, I will traverse down the path of becoming a developer by completing projects, like this professional website. Wish me luck!!</p>
